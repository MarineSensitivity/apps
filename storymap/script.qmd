## Welcome! {#welcome}

Welcome to the _**Storymap**_ that explains BOEM's **Marine Sensitivity Toolkit**.

Simply scroll down to continue. You can always zoom, pan and click on
the map as you go.

## Scores by Cell {#scores_cell}

Let's start by looking at the overall **scores**. 
Note that:

- The **study area** is the entire EEZ (exclusive economic zone) of the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii and the US territories (Puerto Rico and Pacific Island Territories).
- The **values** range from 0 to 89 (blue to red), per the legend in the lower right.
- The **cells** are 0.05° decimal degrees, or roughly 4 km (average of 5 km in the lower 48 states, and 3.2 km in Alaska).

## Scores by Planning Area {#scores_pa}

Alternatively, you can view by BOEM Planning Area, which aggregates the cell scores to the planning area level.

In the rest of the Storymap, we'll learn how these scores get calculated...
